## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- `Pattern.topLevelParser` parses exactly one pattern, as opposed to _one or more_. It's less conservative
in cases like `Ctor one`, where `Pattern.parser` will parse two patterns

### Changed

- Blank lines (zero or any number of whitespace characters) are now tolerated in multi-line strings
- `Number.Float` now includes the originally parsed text representation of the `Float`

### Fixed

- `a.accessor` is no longer parsed as `a .accessor`
- Ctor destructuring always consumed the next pattern as an argument. `Ctor one` was parsed as `(Ctor one)`
- Performance increase when parsing comments
- Long operator chains no longer risks stack overflow

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Module values now has a reference to where the type signature begins, in addition to where the first
type in the type signature starts

### Changed

- `SourcePosition` moved to `Compiler.SourcePosition`
- Nested comments is now supported
- Comments are now represented as an array of `SourcePosition.Located Comment`
- Comment values are no longer trimmed
- Multi-line strings can now contain blank lines without indentation

### Fixed

- Parser can now parse the unicode replacement character literal
- Parsing expressions like `(-a + b)` now works
- Module value names can now start with `type` or `port`
- Fix source position of `Ast.Access`
- Fix source position module values, with or without type signatures

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-22

- First release
